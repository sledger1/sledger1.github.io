XR Hardware Modality Effects on Knowledge Capture and Retention

# DESCRIPTION
WebXR has the advantage of supporting virtual reality and augmented reality applications across a variety of devices. The use of mobile, headmounted display, and projector based extend reality (XR) hardware can significantly improve the adoption rate of XR. The goal of this study is to develop a training simulation that could be deployed on WebXR and used by a variety of devices. 


# OBJECTIVE
The study itself would assess the usability, cybersickness, and usefulness of different XR hardware modalities. The results would influence how training simulations could be implemented in the future. Knowing the effects of hardware modalities on knowledge capture and retention were the original goals but due to time constraints the study was focused on the usability elements, which are still very useful in determing how one might deploy a large XR training to the field. 

# METHODOLOGY
The approach to this study included one WebXR application deployed on a website that would be accessible to any device. Six participants were recruited to complete the scenario with two each assigned to a specific XR hardware modality. The users donned the headmounted display (HMD) or held a mobile phone and interacted with a Toxic Medicine simulation. While using the device, they clicked on different elements to learn more about each toxin. At the end of the simulation, the users completed a series of questionnaires including the Simulator Sickness Questionnaiore (SSQ), NASA TLX - Short for workload and mental demand, and the System Usability Score (SUS) for general usefulness of the user interface. 

# RESULT AND CONCLUSION
The results were mostly based on descriptive statistics based on the limited number of participants. A few results that were suprising was that the VR simulations resulted in no SSQ symptoms and the AR simulation presented a challenging and cumbersome experience. The main outputs of this work is the proof that WebXR can be leveraged for deploying XR simulations to the field and across multiple modalities. 

# FUTURE WORK
Follow-on work can further explore the knowledge capture and retention aspects of these devices. Additional research could also support the deployability and other human factor elements (e.g,. information access effort) for leveraging these different devices.
