# PROJECT TITLE

XR Hardware Modality Effects on Knowledge Capture and Retention

# DESCRIPTION
WebXR has the advantage of supporting virtual reality and augmented reality applications across a variety of devices. The use of mobile, headmounted display, and projector based extend reality (XR) hardware can significantly improve the adoption rate of XR. The goal of this study is to develop a training simulation that could be deployed on WebXR and used by a variety of devices. 


# OBJECTIVE
The study itself would assess the usability, cybersickness, and usefulness of different XR hardware modalities. The results would influence how training simulations could be implemented in the future. Knowing the effects of hardware modalities on knowledge capture and retention were the original goals but due to time constraints the study was focused on the usability elements, which are still very useful in determing how one might deploy a large XR training to the field. 

# METHODOLOGY
The approach to this study included one WebXR application deployed on a website that would be accessible to any device. Six participants were recruited to complete the scenario with two each assigned to a specific XR hardware modality. The users donned the headmounted display (HMD) or held a mobile phone and interacted with a Toxic Medicine simulation. While using the device, they clicked on different elements to learn more about each toxin. At the end of the simulation, the users completed a series of questionnaires including the Simulator Sickness Questionnaiore (SSQ), NASA TLX - Short for workload and mental demand, and the System Usability Score (SUS) for general usefulness of the user interface. 

# RESULT AND CONCLUSION
The results were mostly based on descriptive statistics based on the limited number of participants. A few results that were suprising was that the VR simulations resulted in no SSQ symptoms and the AR simulation presented a challenging and cumbersome experience. The main outputs of this work is the proof that WebXR can be leveraged for deploying XR simulations to the field and across multiple modalities. 

# FUTURE WORK
Follow-on work can further explore the knowledge capture and retention aspects of these devices. Additional research could also support the deployability and other human factor elements (e.g,. information access effort) for leveraging these different devices.

The [`department.json`](#/dept) file configures the header and footer - you should not need to change it.

The [`site.json`](#/site) file configures your site content and navigation.
It contains:
* name of the site.
* a list of markdown pages and links to render and create navigation.

The `pages` element of the [`site.json`](#/site) file is a `[list]` of `{objects}`.
Objects contain `name:value` pairs providing the information needed to create the navigation and render the file content.
* **type** is `page`, `card`, `text`, or `link`.
* **title** is placed in the gray bar at the top of rendered page, card, and text items as well as the vertical menu.
* **menu** is placed in the horizontal menu bar and is much shorter than the title, usually a single word.
* **file** is the location of the file containing markdown content to render for `page`, `card`, and `text` items.
* **url** is the URL associated with the menu for `link` items, no page is rendered.

You can verify the format of the file with [JSON Lint](http://jsonlint.com) if you are having problems.

# Study Results 
All page content is written in markdown format and given the `.md` extension.
Compare the [**Page**](#/page) and [**Card**](#/card) pages with the [**Text**](#/text) page or the [`markdown.md`](#/markdown) file to learn more about how markdown is rendered differently on this site based on the [`site.json`](#/site) type settings.
Compare the [**Faculty**](#/faculty) and [**Course**](#/course) pages with the [`faculty.md`](#/faculty) and [`course.md`](#/course) files for more examples.
