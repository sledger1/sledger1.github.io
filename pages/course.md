This is the page the students would check daily so it should not have a lot of other information on it. 

During the semester the Announcements and Schedule may appear at the top of the page.  
Between semesters the Description and next Semester information may appear at the top of the page.

You can add additional pages for Syllabus, Calendar, Resources, etc. by creating additional markdown files and adding them to the list of pages in the [`site.json`](#/site) file.
